In this project I learned how to use flexboxes in a practical setting, by creating a landing page and customizing what the user sees when the page loads. I struggled with understanding flexbox properties as I was confused several times over why a specific property was behaving the way it was. The bottom-sign-up button was also acting strangely, as it had excess vertical space within the element when it didn't have padding specified. I'm also a bit unfamiliar with align-self, and refrained from using it after failing with the bottom-sign-up button. 

The information flexbox had a giant error, as it would overlap with the quotes section below it, even though it seemingly makes no sense for it to do so. The cause of the issue is still unknown, and a temporary solution of forcing the information flexbox to have a specific height worked, and margin-bottom has also been deemed appropriate to stave the overlap issue. 

In the main container, the example TOP provided included an image that had a wider length than what I used. One concern that emerged was that I didn't want my title texts in the main container to be scrunched so much when resizing the window horizontally. This issue comes from me forcing a column gap between the title texts and the main image. I'm not sure how to combat this.

It was interesting that for anchor elements, it was necessary to apply text-decoration directly on them for them to take effect, instead of the parent element, as far as I understand.

In addition to anchor elements, I also found it necessary to apply list-style-type to the unordered list element for it to take effect, instead of the parent element.

This is also the first project where I used comments as I deemed necessary to organize my CSS better, in addition to using grouping selectors for the first time to reduce code bloat.

Newly learned CSS:
    border-radius
    border-color
    border-style
    column-gap
    text-decoration
    list-style-type
